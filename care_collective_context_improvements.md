# CARE Collective - Context Engineering Improvements

## 1. Enhanced User Context Section

### Primary User Personas
**Sarah - Adult Child Caregiver (Primary)**
- Age: 45-55, working professional with aging parent
- Tech comfort: Moderate (smartphone, basic web)
- Pain points: Time constraints, coordination with siblings, emergency situations
- Accessibility needs: Clear visual hierarchy, large touch targets, simple navigation

**Maria - Spouse Caregiver**
- Age: 65-75, caring for partner with chronic condition
- Tech comfort: Basic (may need larger fonts, simplified UI)
- Pain points: Physical limitations, emotional stress, isolation
- Accessibility needs: High contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility

**Community Care Network**
- Extended family, neighbors, volunteers, part-time professional helpers
- Mixed tech skills and availability patterns
- Need: Simple, mobile-friendly interface for quick help offers/requests

### User Journey Context
**Critical Path 1: Emergency Help Request**
- Caregiver realizes immediate need (medical appointment, emergency)
- Must find help within 2-4 hours
- High stress, needs simple, fast interface
- May be using mobile device

**Critical Path 2: Planned Help Coordination**
- Weekly/monthly recurring needs (grocery shopping, appointments)
- Planning 1-7 days ahead
- Coordination with multiple helpers
- Desktop or mobile usage

## 2. Enhanced Agent Context Loading Protocol

### Context Persistence Strategy
```
/docs/agent-context-digests/
├── shared-project-state.md          # Current sprint, blockers, decisions
├── user-research-insights.md        # Latest user feedback, usability findings
├── technical-decisions-log.md       # ADRs, architecture choices
├── accessibility-requirements.md    # WCAG compliance status, user needs
└── agent-specific/
    ├── tech-lead-decisions.md
    ├── frontend-component-library.md
    ├── backend-schema-status.md
    └── security-audit-status.md
```

### Agent Context Loading Checklist
Each agent must digest:
1. **Current project state** (shared-project-state.md)
2. **Agent-specific context** (their specialized knowledge base)
3. **Cross-agent dependencies** (what other agents are working on)
4. **User research insights** (latest caregiver feedback)
5. **Budget/time remaining** (current burn rate, hours left)

## 3. Feature Prioritization Matrix

### MVP Features (Must-Have for September 2025)
| Feature | Hours Est. | User Value | Tech Complexity | Priority Score |
|---------|------------|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Auth + Basic Profile | 2h | High | Low | 1 |
| Help Request Creation | 3h | Critical | Medium | 1 |
| Help Offer Response | 2h | Critical | Low | 1 |
| Basic Announcements | 2h | Medium | Low | 2 |
| Admin Dashboard | 3h | Medium | Medium | 2 |

### Future Features (Post-MVP)
- Advanced matching algorithms
- In-app messaging
- Video integration
- Mobile app
- Advanced reporting

## 4. Enhanced Decision Framework

### Tech Lead Decision Matrix
For any new feature/change, evaluate:
1. **Caregiver Impact Score** (1-5): How much does this help stressed caregivers?
2. **Implementation Hours** (actual estimate)
3. **Security Risk Level** (1-5): Data exposure, privacy concerns
4. **Accessibility Impact** (1-5): Does this improve or complicate accessibility?
5. **Budget Fit** (hours remaining vs. hours needed)

**Decision Rule:** Features need Caregiver Impact ≥ 4 AND Budget Fit = True AND Security Risk ≤ 2

## 5. Inter-Agent Communication Protocol

### Daily Sync Format (Async via Context Files)
```markdown
## Agent: [Color] [Name]
**Current Task:** [What I'm working on]
**Blockers:** [What's stopping me, who can help]
**Context Updates:** [New insights, decisions, user feedback]
**Handoff Needed:** [What I need from other agents]
**Hours Burned Today:** [X.X hours]
```

### Critical Decision Escalation
- **Budget risk** (>80% burned): Auto-alert Tech Lead
- **Security concern**: Auto-alert Security Auditor
- **Accessibility blocker**: Auto-alert QA & Accessibility Specialist
- **User feedback contradiction**: Alert UX/UI Designer + Tech Lead

## 6. Context Quality Assurance

### Weekly Context Audit Checklist
- [ ] All agent digests updated within 48h
- [ ] Shared project state reflects current reality
- [ ] Budget tracking accurate (±10%)
- [ ] User research insights reflect latest feedback
- [ ] Technical decisions documented with rationale
- [ ] Security requirements still current
- [ ] Accessibility status accurate

### Context Validation Questions
1. Can a new agent join and be productive within 30 minutes of context review?
2. Do agents have enough context to make autonomous decisions within their domain?
3. Are user needs and constraints clearly visible to all agents?
4. Is the current project state accurate and actionable?

## 7. Enhanced Risk Management Context

### Project Risk Register
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|-------|
| Budget overrun | Medium | High | Hourly tracking, scope cuts | Tech Lead |
| Accessibility gaps | Low | High | Early audits, user testing | QA Specialist |
| Security vulnerability | Low | Critical | Security reviews at each phase | Security Auditor |
| User adoption issues | Medium | Medium | Simple UI, user testing | UX Designer |

### Risk Monitoring Triggers
- Budget >80% used with <80% features complete
- Security audit findings rated "High" or "Critical"
- Accessibility audit score <85%
- User testing feedback satisfaction <7/10
