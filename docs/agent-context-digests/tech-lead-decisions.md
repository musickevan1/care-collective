# Tech Lead - Architectural Decisions & Setup

## Setup Decisions Made

### 1. Development Workflow
- **Branch Strategy:** `development` branch for all initial work, feature branches for major components
- **Package Manager:** npm (for ecosystem consistency)  
- **Directory Structure:** Domain-organized (components, lib, types) for scalability
- **Git Strategy:** Small, focused commits with clear messages

### 2. Technology Stack Decisions

#### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 with App Router (React Server Components)
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode enabled)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v3 with custom accessibility-focused configuration
- **UI Components:** Custom components built on accessibility patterns
- **Icons:** Lucide React for consistent, accessible icons

#### Backend & Database
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security)
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth with @supabase/ssr for modern Next.js integration
- **Real-time:** Supabase real-time subscriptions for live updates
- **CMS:** Payload CMS (planned for admin dashboard)

#### Development & Testing
- **Linting:** ESLint with Next.js config
- **Testing:** Playwright for E2E, Jest for unit tests (to be configured)
- **Accessibility:** Built-in WCAG 2.2 AA compliance patterns

### 3. Accessibility-First Configuration

#### Color System
```typescript
primary: {
  400: '#f97316', // Main warm orange - meets contrast requirements
  50: '#fef7ed',  // Light backgrounds
  900: '#7f1d1d'  // High contrast text
}
```

#### Typography
- **Base Size:** 16px (never smaller for body text)
- **Font:** Inter with system fallbacks
- **Line Height:** 1.5+ for readability
- **Font Weights:** Limited palette for consistency

#### Interaction Design
- **Touch Targets:** Minimum 44px Ã— 44px
- **Focus States:** Visible outline with 2px offset
- **Color Contrast:** All combinations meet WCAG AA standards
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Full support required

### 4. Caregiver-Focused Design Principles

#### User Context Considerations
- **Primary Users:** Stressed family caregivers (45-75 age range)
- **Tech Comfort:** Basic to moderate
- **Usage Context:** Often mobile, high-stress situations
- **Accessibility Needs:** Larger text, high contrast, simple navigation

#### Design Components
- **Buttons:** Large, clear labels with sufficient padding
- **Forms:** Single-column layout with clear validation
- **Navigation:** Simple, consistent patterns
- **Language:** Plain language, avoiding technical jargon

## Critical Architecture Decisions

### 1. Data Security Strategy
- **Row-Level Security (RLS):** All user data protected at database level
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth with secure session management
- **API Security:** Server-side validation for all data mutations
- **Privacy:** Minimal data collection, GDPR considerations

### 2. Performance Strategy  
- **Server Components:** Minimize client-side JavaScript
- **Image Optimization:** Next.js Image component with Supabase storage
- **Code Splitting:** Automatic with Next.js App Router
- **Caching:** Strategic use of React cache and Supabase cache

### 3. Scalability Considerations
- **Database Design:** Normalized schema with proper indexing (Backend Agent responsibility)
- **Component Architecture:** Reusable, composable patterns
- **State Management:** React Server Components + Supabase subscriptions
- **Deployment:** Vercel for automatic scaling

## Next Critical Decisions Needed

### 1. Database Schema Design (Backend Agent)
- User profiles and caregiver relationships
- Help request/offer data model
- Announcement and notification systems
- Admin/moderation capabilities

### 2. Authentication Flow (UX Designer + Backend Agent)
- Onboarding experience for caregivers
- Profile setup and verification
- Password reset and account recovery
- Multi-device session management

### 3. Component Library (Frontend Agent)
- Design system implementation
- Form patterns for help requests
- Navigation components
- Notification/alert patterns

## Constraints & Limitations

### Budget Constraints
- **Total Time:** 20 hours across all agents
- **Scope Limitation:** MVP only - advanced features post-launch
- **Quality Gate:** Accessibility and security cannot be compromised

### Technical Constraints
- **Browser Support:** Modern browsers only (last 2 versions)
- **Mobile-First:** Design for mobile, enhance for desktop
- **Offline Support:** Not in MVP scope
- **Real-time Scale:** Small community sizes initially

### User Constraints
- **Low Technical Literacy:** Interface must be extremely simple
- **High Stress Context:** Clear, calm visual design required
- **Accessibility Requirements:** Full WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
- **Privacy Concerns:** Transparent data handling

## Handoff Notes for Next Agents

### For Backend & Database Engineer
- Supabase project setup will need credentials from user
- Focus on RLS policies for data security
- Consider caregiver relationship modeling carefully
- Plan for announcement/notification systems

### For Frontend Engineer  
- Build on established Tailwind component patterns
- Follow accessibility guidelines in tailwind.config.ts
- Use established utility functions in lib/utils.ts
- Maintain 44px minimum touch targets

### For Security Auditor
- Review RLS policies thoroughly
- Audit authentication flow implementation
- Validate input sanitization across all forms
- Test for common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.)
