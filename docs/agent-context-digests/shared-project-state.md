## Current Sprint: Project Bootstrap & Foundation
**Date:** July 26, 2025  
**Phase:** Initial Setup & Technical Foundation  
**Agent:** Tech Lead (Bootstrap Phase)

## Technical State
- **Repository:** ✅ Git initialized, remote connected to https://github.com/musickevan1/care-collective.git
- **Branch Strategy:** Development branch ready for creation
- **Environment:** ✅ Local development environment configured
- **Dependencies:** ✅ Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase SSR, utilities installed
- **Architecture:** ✅ Accessibility-first design system established

## Budget Status
- **Total Budget:** 20 hours ($500 @ $25/hour)
- **Current Phase Estimated:** 3.5 hours for complete bootstrap
- **Spent So Far:** ~2.5 hours (Tech Lead setup work)
- **Remaining:** ~17.5 hours for feature development
- **Burn Rate:** On track for budget constraints

## Current Blockers
- [ ] Supabase project credentials needed (user will provide in Phase 2)
- [ ] Development branch creation and push pending
- [ ] Payload CMS integration pending for admin features

## Next Priority Actions
1. **Complete Bootstrap** - Finish documentation and initial commit (0.5h)
2. **Backend Agent Handoff** - Database schema design and Supabase setup (2h estimate)
3. **Frontend Agent** - Core UI components and layouts (3h estimate)
4. **Security Audit** - Initial security setup and RLS configuration (1h estimate)

## Architecture Decisions Made
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 15 + App Router + TypeScript + Supabase + Tailwind
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.2 AA compliance built into design system
- **Color Palette:** Warm, calming colors for stressed caregivers (primary orange #f97316)
- **Typography:** Inter font with 16px base size for readability
- **Touch Targets:** Minimum 44px per WCAG guidelines
- **Development Workflow:** Feature branch from development, agent handoffs via context files

## User Context Priorities
- **Primary Users:** Adult child caregivers (45-55) and spouse caregivers (65-75)
- **Critical Path 1:** Emergency help requests (2-4 hour response needed)
- **Critical Path 2:** Planned help coordination (1-7 days ahead)
- **Accessibility Needs:** High contrast, large touch targets, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

## Success Criteria for Current Phase
- [x] Next.js 15 project bootstrapped with TypeScript
- [x] Accessibility-first Tailwind configuration
- [x] Project structure for multi-agent development
- [x] Git repository and development workflow setup
- [ ] Agent context documentation system operational
- [ ] Budget tracking system initialized
- [ ] Development environment verified working
- [ ] Initial commit and branch creation completed

## Notes for Next Agent
- Supabase credentials will be provided during Phase 2 setup
- Focus has been on accessibility foundations from start
- All component patterns follow caregiver-focused design principles
- Budget constraint is tight - prioritize MVP features per context improvements document
